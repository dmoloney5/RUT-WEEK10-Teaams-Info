# RUT-WEEK10-Teaams-Info
 ## Description
  I created a app to display Manager, Engineer and Intern (just like an Org chart).  Once you run the index,js it will ask you several question.  Once you answer all of them it will then produce a index.html that looks like my screenshot below.  Kevein Ferguson "class Instructor" provide the class with most of the code for this project.  Our job was to code the employee, manager, engineer and intern js files.  I also had to modify the htmlrenderer.js to work properly.
